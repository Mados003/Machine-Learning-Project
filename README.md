Activity Recognition with Machine Learning and Neural Networks
This project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models for activity recognition using the MHEALTH dataset. The goal is to accurately predict activity labels based on sensor data.

Overview
The project compares the performance of various models, including:

Logistic Regression: A simple, interpretable model with robustness to noise and outliers.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A more complex model capable of higher accuracy but sensitive to noise.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): An intuitive, instance-based model with simplicity in training.
Neural Networks: The best-performing model, demonstrating the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Key Features
Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the models' generalization capabilities.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Comparison and Analysis: The strengths, weaknesses, and performance variations of each model are discussed in detail.
Results
The neural network model outperformed other models in recognizing activities, demonstrating its ability to learn and generalize effectively from the MHEALTH dataset.

Conclusion
This project highlights the potential of machine learning, particularly neural networks, for activity recognition tasks. While simpler models like Logistic Regression offer ease of use and interpretability, neural networks excel in accuracy and overall performance.
